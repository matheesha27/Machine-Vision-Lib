# Machine-Vision-Lib
This repo consist of the assignments and other code snippets of the module EN4553 - Machine Vision.

In this part of the assignment, the following parts are covered.
  1. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in sklearn to classify IRIS data.
  2. Use Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) and SVM classifier in sklearn to classify CIFAR-10 dataset images.
  3. Writing an SVM classifier using a convex optimization package like convex optimization (cvxopt).
  4. Running a two-layer fully-connected (FC) network for CIFAR-10 in tensorflow.

The code snippets are given in the "Codes" folder and the notebook file is also included.
